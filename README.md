This service manages user *accounts*.  The data is backed by a CouchDB-complient document database (Cloudant, CouchDB).  The following operations are available:

`GET /` - gets all accounts.

`POST /{owner}` - creates a new account for the specified owner.

`GET /{owner}` - gets details for the specified account.

`PUT /{owner}?total={total}` - updates the account total for the specified owner (by adding a stock).

`DELETE /{owner}` - removes the account for the specified owner.

`POST /{owner}/feedback` - submits feedback (to the Watson Tone Analyzer)

All operations return *JSON*.  An *account* object contains fields named *owner*, *total*, *loyalty*, *balance*,
*commissions*, *free*, *sentiment*, and *nextCommission*. The only operation that takes any
query params is the `PUT` operation, which expects a param named *total*.  Also, the `feedback`
operation takes a JSON object in the http body, with a single field named *text*.

This microservice calls out to three other external services. First, there is a business rule that determines the Loyalty Level
of this account. This is called via REST. `POST`ing feedback also makes a REST call to Watson to determine the sentiment and, potentially,
provide free trades depending on the sentiment. Finally, there is a Jakarta Messaging message that is sent when the loyalty level changes.  All three of these
services are optional.

The code should work with any *document-based NoSQL* provider that supports the CouchDB API.  It has been tested with **CouchDB** and with **Cloudant**.
The database can either be another pod in the same *Kubernetes* environment, or
it can be running on "bare metal" in a traditional on-premises environment.  Endpoint and credential info is
specified in the *Kubernetes* secret and made available as environment variables to the application.properties of Quarkus.  See the *manifests/portfolio-values.yaml* for details.

The Jakarta Messaging functionality supports any AMQP 1.0 messaging provider. IBM MQ 9.2.x+ (with [AMQP 1.0 support enabled](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/mq-setting-up-amqp-with-mq)) and Apache ActiveMQ have both been tested.

### Build 
#### Build and run Quarkus locally 

To build `account` and run in dev mode, locally, clone this repo and run:
```bash
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

#### Build container and push to container registry
```bash
./mvnw clean install -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \                                                                                                              ✔  base   system   14:26:36  
    -Dquarkus.container-image.tag=<your tag> \
    -Dquarkus.container-image.group=ibmstocktrader \
    -Dquarkus.container-image.registry=<YOUR REGISTRY HOST> 

docker push <YOUR REGISTRY HOST AND REPOSITORY>

```

#### Run container

In practice this means you'll run something like:
```bash
docker run -i --rm -p 9080:9080 <your repository>/account 
```
