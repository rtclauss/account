This service manages a *stock portfolio*.  The data is backed by two **DB2** tables, communicated with
via *JDBC*.  The following operations are available:

`GET /` - gets summary data for all portfolios.

`POST /{owner}` - creates a new portfolio for the specified owner.

`GET /{owner}` - gets details for the specified owner.

`PUT /{owner}` - updates the portfolio for the specified owner (by adding a stock).

`DELETE /{owner}` - removes the portfolio for the specified owner.

`GET /{owner}/returns` - gets the return on investment for this portfolio.

`POST /{owner}/feedback` - submits feedback (to the Watson Tone Analyzer)

All operations return *JSON*.  A *portfolio* object contains fields named *owner*, *total*, *loyalty*, *balance*,
*commissions*, *free*, *sentiment*, and *nextCommission*, plus an array of *stocks*.  A *stock* object contains
fields named *symbol*, *shares*, *commission*, *price*, *total*, and *date*.  The only operation that takes any
query params is the `PUT` operation, which expects params named *symbol* and *shares*.  Also, the `feedback`
operation takes a JSON object in the http body, with a single field named *text*.

For example, doing a `PUT http://localhost:9080/portfolio/John?symbol=IBM&shares=123` (against a freshly
created portfolio for *John*) would return *JSON* like `{"owner": "John", "total": 19120.35, "loyalty": "Bronze",
"balance": 40.01, "commissions": 9.99, "free": 0, "sentiment": "Unknown", "nextCommission": 8.99, "stocks":
[{"symbol": "IBM", "shares": 123, "commission": 9.99, "price": 155.45, "total": 19120.35, "date": "2017-06-26"}]}`.

The above REST call would also add a row to the Stocks table via a SQL statement like `INSERT INTO Stock
(owner, symbol, shares, price, total, dateQuoted) VALUES ('John', 'IBM', 123, 155.45, 19120.35, '2017-06-26')`,
and would update the corresponding row in the Portfolio table via a SQL statement like
`UPDATE Portfolio SET total = 19120.35, loyalty = 'Bronze' WHERE owner = 'John'`.

The code should work with any *JDBC* provider.  It has been tested with **DB2** and with **Derby**.  Changing
providers simply means updating the *Dockerfile* to copy the *JDBC* jar file into the Docker image, and updating
the *server.xml* to reference it and specify any database-specific settings.  No *Java* code changes are necessary
when changing *JDBC* providers.  The database can either be another pod in the same *Kubernetes* environment, or
it can be running on "bare metal" in a traditional on-premises environment.  Endpoint and credential info is
specified in the *Kubernetes* secret and made available as environment variables to the server.xml of WebSphere
Liberty.  See the *manifests/portfolio-values.yaml* for details.

### Build 
#### Build and run Quarkus locally 

To build `account` clone this repo and run:
```bash
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

#### Build container
```bash
./mvnw package
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile-old-liberty.jvm -t <your repository>/account .
```

#### Run container

In practice this means you'll run something like:
```bash
docker run -i --rm -p 9080:9080 <your repository>/account 
```
